      <description>Introduction The European Anaphylaxis Registry is a uniqe database, that gathers anaphylaxis cases along with high quality clinical data. It is maintained by the NORA e.V.. I&amp;rsquo;m lucky to be working on this challenging dataset as a data scientist.
My job in the project My work on the European Anaphylaxis Registry started in 2015. I first looked into the sex differences in anaphylaxis severity. Next, I was investigating the influence of aggrevating factors on the severity of anaphylaxis.</description>

      <description>My work on Negative Pressure Wound Therapy use in Dermatology started in 2014. I first descibed a case report where NPWT was used after surgical procedure in a patient with acne inversa.
Then, I was intersted in following up on how to cut costs of NPWT in hospital setting to make this techniqe more easily availible. This reaseach is ongoing and I will share more details in the future.</description>
