      <description>Why do scientists still use journal articles as main form of sharing their research? The paper publication has been with the academics since ages and it surely does need an update.
The variety of outputs we have to offer ar modern scientists had dramatically evolved and contains multigiabyte databases along with high quality images, and simple text output.
We therefore need a modern medium which allows sharing such sophisticated data and paper simply is not suited for this.</description>

      <description>Introduction This is my initial post. Communication in science is changing not so rapidly as it should. Use of new tools and methods may drive change in the way we communicate experiment results. I have been using R and Rstudio extensively since last 4 years. It has proven exeptionally well suited for making science and my latest attempts at producing full manuscripts in RStudio were suprisingly successful. This lead me to investigating new forms of scientific communication.</description>
